Stress / Integration Test for fastlane and ITC / Play Store !

Right now this project allows to stress test deliver / supply on fake projects.

* set metadata with 4 languages on a projet, remove all screenshots, and upload 1, then 30, then 120 screenshots

To get started:

1. create a test project on ITC

2. copy fastlane/.env.default into fastlane/.env and edit it as described

3. sh run.sh (the first time, if you haven't entered your Apple credentials, it will ask for them and store them)

Once you have ran the script once, you can either keep running it, or play with different scenarios. E.g. 

ruby scripts/run_loop.rb

If you want to change the screenshots have a look at 

   ruby bin/genimages_itc.rb fixtures/ios
   ruby bin/genimages_play.rb fixtures/android

   (this requires ImageMagick)
